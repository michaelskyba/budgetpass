# BudgetPass
budgetpass: a low-budget password manager written in Go

## FAQ
1. Are you, michaelskyba, a security expert?

Nope. I am completely incompetent.

2. With your limited understanding, how would you describe budgetpass's security?

I'd say that it's better than storing your passwords in a text file, but it's nowhere near as "good" as a real password manager.

3. Why did you make this, then, if it's so useless?

The primary objective was to become more familiar with Go. After that, I also wanted a minimal, scriptable password manager that didn't require transferring your private key from computer to computer. Together, it's a "decent" project?
